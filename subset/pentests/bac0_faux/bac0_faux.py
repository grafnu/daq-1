import BAC0

bacnet = BAC0.connect()
# or specify the IP you want to use / bacnet = BAC0.connect(ip='192.168.1.10/24')
# by default, it will attempt an internet connection and use the network adapter
# connected to the internet.
# Specifying the network mask will allow the usage of a local broadcast address
# like 192.168.1.255 instead of the global broadcast address 255.255.255.255
# which could be blocked in some cases.
# You can also use :
# bacnet = BAC0.lite() to force the script to load only minimum features.
# Please note that if Bokeh, Pandas or Flask are not installed, using connect() will in fact call the lite version.

# Create a test controller

faux_bacnet_controller = BAC0.device('3:4', 5504, bacnet)

# Get the list of devices seen on the network
print('Bacnet devices: ', bacnet.devices)

# Define a controller (this one is on MSTP #3, MAC addr 4, device ID 5504)
# mycontroller = BAC0.device('3:4', 5504, bacnet)

# Get the list of "registered" devices
print('Registered devices: ', bacnet.registered_devices)
